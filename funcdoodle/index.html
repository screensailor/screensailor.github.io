  <p class="tagline">Instead of typing functions to see their graphs, simply draw lines with your finger and let <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> figure out the formulas. </p>

  <p>Tap on a line you drew to see its function, then watch the line move and wiggle as you slide the parameters. And since doodling function graphs like this is such a direct and free-flowing experience, <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> is also a smooth drawing app!</p>

  <p>We invite you to surprise us with some cool math art as well as to share it with your friends and teachers. We are looking forward to featuring the coolest (and the cutest) on this website!</p>

  <p>After having fun with <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span>, functions and graphs you encounter at school will no longer feel intimidating but familiar and easy to master. More and more teachers encourage their students to play creatively with graphing calculator apps and compose pictures out of function graphs. There are thousands of wonderful examples of such artwork on the Internet.</p>

  <p>Of course, graphing calculators are not really designed for this, so making an exciting drawing involves painstakingly typing out a function for each and every line. To our best knowledge, <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> is the first app that was designed especially to make doodling functions a joyful and engaging learning experience.</p>
  
  <p>With this first version of the app, <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> can already recognise three classes of functions, which together allow for a wide range of expressive strokes:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>polynomial</strong></li>
        <li><strong>elliptic</strong></li>
        <li><strong>sine</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
  <small>Note that the first two classes include most of the conic sections - i.e. circles, ellipses and parabolas.</small>
    
  <p>As you can imagine, we are dying to hear from you!</p>
    
  <p><span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> is a new kind of app and we are very excited to develop it further. We have a rather long list of novel features that we plan to introduce with the coming updates. But this is also the best time for us to learn from you, our early adopters! What would you like us to add, take away, or improve? We are eager to learn about the way you are using <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> and how you think we can make it even more useful and fun. Here are some of the specific questions that keep us awake at night:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>In what additional ways would you like to export your doodles?</strong> Export animated GIFs? Export to social networking sites or great graphing calculator apps like Desmos? Export to online t-shirt printing services (doodle on one side, functions on the other)?</li>
    
        <li><strong>What additional shapes would you like <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> to learn?</strong> Spirals, hearts, flowers (in polar coordinates)? Solid shapes (as inequalities)?</li>
    
        <li><strong>Would you be interested in sharing your doodles with a community of <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span>rs on our website?</strong> Should this be our first priority?</li>
    
        <li><strong>What ages find <span class="funcdoodle"><em>func</em>Doodle</span> especially rewarding?</strong> (Our early testers ranged from 5 to 42!)</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Have fun and keep in touch!</p>
